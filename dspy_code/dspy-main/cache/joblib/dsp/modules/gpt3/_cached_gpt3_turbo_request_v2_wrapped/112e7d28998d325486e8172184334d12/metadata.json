We know that the 1972 FA Charity Shield was contested between Manchester City and Aston Villa. To find out the year the club founded that played against Manchester City, we need to search for the founding year of Aston Villa.\\\\n\\\\nQuery: \\\\\"Aston Villa founding year\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nContext:\\\\n[1] \\\\u00abEmpire State Building | The Empire State Building is a 102-story skyscraper located on Fifth Avenue between West 33rd and 34th Streets in Midtown, Manhattan, New York City. It has a roof height of 1,250 feet (381 m), and with its antenna included, it stands a total of 1454 ft tall. Its name is derived from the nickname for New York, the Empire State.\\\\u00bb\\\\n[2] \\\\u00abBank of America Plaza (Atlanta) | Bank of America Plaza is a skyscraper located in between Midtown Atlanta and Downtown Atlanta. At 312 m , the tower is the 96th-tallest building in the world.

It has 55 stories of office space and was completed in 1992, when it was called NationsBank Plaza.

We know that the Empire State Building has a roof height of 1,250 feet and a total height of 1,454 feet including its antenna. On the other hand, the Bank of America Plaza in Atlanta is 312 meters tall. To compare the heights of the two buildings, we need to convert the height of the Bank of America Plaza from meters to feet.\\\\n\\\\nQuery: \\\\\"Convert 312 meters to feet\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nContext:\\\\n[1] \\\\u00abAleksandr Danilovich Aleksandrov | Aleksandr Danilovich Aleksandrov (Russian: \\\\u0410\\\\u043b\\\\u0435\\\\u043a\\\\u0441\\\\u0430\\\\u0301\\\\u043d\\\\u0434\\\\u0440 \\\\u0414\\\\u0430\\\\u043d\\\\u0438\\\\u0301\\\\u043b\\\\u043e\\\\u0432\\\\u0438\\\\u0447 \\\\u0410\\\\u043b\\\\u0435\\\\u043a\\\\u0441\\\\u0430\\\\u0301\\\\u043d\\\\u0434\\\\u0440\\\\u043e\\\\u0432 , alternative transliterations: \\\\\"Alexandr\\\\\" or \\\\\"Alexander\\\\\" (first name), and \\\\\"Alexandrov\\\\\" (last name)) (August 4, 1912 \\\\u2013 July 27, 1999), was a Soviet/Russian mathematician, physicist, philosopher and mountaineer.\\\\u00bb\\\\n[2] \\\\u00abAleksandr Pavlovich Aleksandrov | Aleksandr Pavlovich Aleksandrov (Russian: \\\\u0410\\\\u043b\\\\u0435\\\\u043a\\\\u0441\\\\u0430\\\\u043d\\\\u0434\\\\u0440 \\\\u041f\\\\u0430\\\\u0432\\\\u043b\\\\u043e\\\\u0432\\\\u0438\\\\u0447 \\\\u0410\\\\u043b\\\\u0435\\\\u043a\\\\u0441\\\\u0430\\\\u043d\\\\u0434\\\\u0440\\\\u043e\\\\u0432 ; born February 20, 1943) is a former Soviet cosmonaut and twice Hero of the Soviet Union (November 23, 1983 and December 29, 1987).\\\\u00bb\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Who is older, Aleksandr Danilovich Aleksandrov or Anatoly Fomenko?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the query.
