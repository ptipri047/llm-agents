Despite having been 1\\\\u20130 down after two Tests, England won the next three Tests to finish 3\\\\u20131 victors (with two draws), thus retaining the Ashes. The series is popularly known as Botham\\'s Ashes, owing to the remarkable performances of Ian Botham with both bat and ball.\\\\u00bb\\\\n[2] \\\\u00abEnglish cricket team in Australia in 1979\\\\u201380 | The England national cricket team toured Australia from November 1979 to February 1980 and played a three-match Test series against the Australia national cricket team. Australia won the Test series 3\\\\u20130. England were captained by Mike Brearley; Australia by Greg Chappell. In addition, the teams played in a triangular Limited Overs International (LOI) tournament with the West Indies cricket team. The West Indies won this tournament, defeating England in the final.\\\\u00bb\\\\n[3] \\\\u00abAustralian cricket team in Australia in 1974\\\\u201375 | The 1974\\\\u201375 Australians beat the touring England team 4\\\\u20131 in the 1974-75 Ashes series. Labelled the \\\\\"Ugly Australians\\\\\" for their hard-nosed cricket, sledging and hostile fast bowling they are regarded as one of the toughest teams in cricket history. Don Bradman ranked them just after his powerful teams of the late 1940s, and Tom Graveney third amongst post-war cricket teams after the 1948 Australians and 1984 West Indians. The spearhead of the team was the fast-bowling duo of Dennis Lillee, whose hatred of English batsmen was well known, and Jeff Thomson, who outraged old fashioned cricketers by saying he liked to see \\\\\"blood on the wicket\\\\\". \\\\\" Wisden\\\\\" reported that \\\\\"never in the 98 years of Test cricket have batsmen been so grievously bruised and battered by ferocious, hostile, short-pitched balls\\\\\". \\\\\"Behind the batsmen, Rod Marsh and his captain Ian Chappell would vie with each other in profanity\\\\\", but the predatory wicketkeeper and Australian slip cordon snapped up most chances that came their way. Their batting line up was also impressive with the opener Ian Redpath spending over 32 hours at the crease in the series, followed by Rick McCosker, Ian and Greg Chappell, Doug Walters and Ross Edwards. Ironically, in the last Test of the series Lillee and Thomson were injured, the out of form England captain Mike Denness made 188 and England won by an innings.\\\\u00bb\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: What cricketeer active 1974\\\\u20131993 had a strong performance in the tour by the Australian cricket team in England in 1981?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1692121278.76312}
