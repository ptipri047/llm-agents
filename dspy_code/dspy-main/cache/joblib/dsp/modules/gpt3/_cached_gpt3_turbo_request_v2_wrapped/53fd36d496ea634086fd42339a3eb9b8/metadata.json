Written in 1903, it was first published by \\\\\"Znaniye\\\\\" (Book Two, 1904), and came out as a separate edition later that year in Saint Petersburg, via A.F. Marks Publishers. It opened at the Moscow Art Theatre on 17 January 1904 in a production directed by Konstantin Stanislavski. Chekhov described the play as a comedy, with some elements of farce, though Stanislavski treated it as a tragedy. Since its first production, directors have contended with its dual nature. It is often identified as one of the three or four outstanding plays by Chekhov, along with \\\\\"The Seagull\\\\\", \\\\\"Three Sisters\\\\\", and \\\\\"Uncle Vanya\\\\\".\\\\u00bb\\\\n[4] \\\\u00abPlatonov (play) | Platonov (Russian: \\\\u041f\\\\u043b\\\\u0430\\\\u0442\\\\u043e\\\\u043d\\\\u043e\\\\u0432 , also known as \\\\\"Fatherlessness\\\\\" and \\\\\"A Play Without a Title\\\\\") is the name in English given to an early, untitled play in four acts written by Anton Chekhov in 1878.
