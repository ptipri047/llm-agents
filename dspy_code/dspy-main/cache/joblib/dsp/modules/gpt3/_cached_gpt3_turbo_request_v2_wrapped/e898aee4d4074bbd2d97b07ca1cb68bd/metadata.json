He became the founder of the House of Kiszka. He was sent on diplomatic missions to the Grand Duchy of Moscow and Kingdom of Poland.

After marriage to Anna, daughter of Stanis\\\\u0142aw Kiszka, Stanislovas was the wealthiest magnate in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.\\\\u00bb\\\\n[4] \\\\u00ab1528 census of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania | The census of 1528 was the first census carried out in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It was not a true census since it had limited scope: it only sought to count peasant households (Lithuanian: \\\\\"d\\\\u016bmas\\\\\" ) for military purposes. The Grand Duchy used a conscript army where Lithuanian nobles were required to provide one soldier per each 16 or 20 households owned. Therefore, the state needed to count such households to know whether a noble fulfilled his military duty. The next census was conducted in 1565.\\\\u00bb\\\\n[5] \\\\u00abVeldamas | Veldamas (plural: \\\\\"veldamai\\\\\") was a form of landownership in the early stages of Lithuanian serfdom. The term describes a peasant family with its land and other belongings granted by the Grand Duke of Lithuania to his loyal followers, usually as a reward for military service. The peasant retained ownership of his property, including land, but owed taxes and levies imposed by the noble. \\\\\"Veldamas\\\\\" was a middle stage between \\\\\"laukininkas\\\\\" (a free peasant) and a serf. The term \\\\\"veldamas\\\\\" is derived from Lithuanian word \\\\\"veld\\\\u0117ti\\\\\", \\\\\"valda\\\\\" and means \\\\\"to rule something\\\\\". Slavic texts loaned the word as \\\\u0432\\\\u0435\\\\u043b\\\\u0434\\\\u043e\\\\u043c\\\\u044b.

It was active from 1445 to 1569, when it was officially abolished by the Union of Lublin. The Seimas was an irregular gathering of the Lithuanian nobility, called as needed by the Grand Duke or during an interregnum by the Lithuanian Council of Lords (an early government). The meetings would usually last one or two weeks. Seimas gradually evolved from a meeting of the most powerful magnates to a full legislative institution representing all of the nobility. The Seimas was not the main political player as it was overshadowed by the Council of Lords. The Union of Lublin created a new state, the Polish\\\\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, and joined the Seimas of Lithuania with Sejm of Poland into one Sejm of the Polish\\\\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. However, the Seimas continued to convene under the name of Lithuanian Convocation. In total there were 40 Seimas and 37 Convocations.\\\\u00bb\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Was Stanislaw Kiszka paid for his services by the Royal Treasury?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1692121280.5027587}
