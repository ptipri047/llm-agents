His surname is sometimes spelt as Gregorie, the original Scottish spelling. He inherited Kinnairdy Castle in 1664. Three of his twenty-nine children became mathematics professors. He is credited with inventing a military cannon that Isaac Newton described as \\\\\"being destructive to the human species\\\\\". Copies and details of the model no longer exist. Gregory\\'s use of a barometer to predict farming-related weather conditions led him to be accused of witchcraft by Presbyterian ministers from Aberdeen, although he was never convicted.\\\\u00bb\\\\n[2] \\\\u00abThe Boleyn Inheritance | The Boleyn Inheritance is a novel by British author Philippa Gregory which was first published in 2006. It is a direct sequel to her previous novel \\\\\"The Other Boleyn Girl,\\\\\" and one of the additions to her six-part series on the Tudor royals. (The other titles in the series are \\\\\"The Constant Princess,\\\\\" \\\\\"The Queen\\'s Fool,\\\\\" \\\\\"The Virgin\\'s Lover,and The Other Queen.\\\\\") * The novel is told through the first-person narratives of \\\\u2013 Anne of Cleves, Katherine Howard, and Jane Boleyn, who was mentioned in \\\\\"The Other Boleyn Girl.\\\\\" It covers a period from 1539 until 1542 and chronicles the fourth and fifth marriages of King Henry VIII of England.\\\\u00bb\\\\n[3] \\\\u00abGregory of Gaeta | Gregory was the Duke of Gaeta from 963 until his death. He was the second son of Docibilis II of Gaeta and his wife Orania. He succeeded his brother John II, who had left only daughters. Gregory rapidly depleted the \\\\\"publicum\\\\\" (public land) of the Duchy of Gaeta by doling it out to family members as grants. Gregory disappears from the records in 964 and was succeeded by his younger brother Marinus of Fondi over the heads of his three sons. It is possible that there was an internal power struggle between factions of the Docibilan family and that Gregory was forced out. On the other hand, perhaps he died and his sons fought a losing battle for their inheritance to Gaeta.\\\\u00bb\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: How many storeys are in the castle that David Gregory inherited?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1692121276.3089054}
