Written in 1903, it was first published by \\\\\"Znaniye\\\\\" (Book Two, 1904), and came out as a separate edition later that year in Saint Petersburg, via A.F. Marks Publishers. It opened at the Moscow Art Theatre on 17 January 1904 in a production directed by Konstantin Stanislavski. Chekhov described the play as a comedy, with some elements of farce, though Stanislavski treated it as a tragedy. Since its first production, directors have contended with its dual nature. It is often identified as one of the three or four outstanding plays by Chekhov, along with \\\\\"The Seagull\\\\\", \\\\\"Three Sisters\\\\\", and \\\\\"Uncle Vanya\\\\\".\\\\u00bb\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: The original work by Anton Chekhov involving a disillusioned schoolmaster, which inspired a later play by this British playwright, was written specifically for whom?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1692121278.9489455}
