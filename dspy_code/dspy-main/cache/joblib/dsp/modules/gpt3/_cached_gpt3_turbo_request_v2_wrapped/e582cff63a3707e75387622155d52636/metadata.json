The battle began with the launch of the German offensive, Operation Citadel (German: \\\\\"Unternehmen Zitadelle\\\\\" ), on 5 July, which had the objective of pinching off the Kursk salient with attacks on the base of the salient from north and south simultaneously. After the German offensive stalled on the northern side of the salient, on 12 July the Soviets commenced their Kursk Strategic Offensive Operation with the launch of Operation Kutuzov (Russian: \\\\u041a\\\\u0443\\\\u0442\\\\u0443\\\\u0437\\\\u043e\\\\u0432 ) against the rear of the German forces in the northern side. On the southern side, the Soviets also launched powerful counterattacks the same day, one of which led to a large armoured clash, the Battle of Prokhorovka. On 3 August, the Soviets began the second phase of the Kursk Strategic Offensive Operation with the launch of Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev (Russian: \\\\u041f\\\\u043e\\\\u043b\\\\u043a\\\\u043e\\\\u0432\\\\u043e\\\\u0434\\\\u0435\\\\u0446 \\\\u0420\\\\u0443\\\\u043c\\\\u044f\\\\u043d\\\\u0446\\\\u0435\\\\u0432 ) against the German forces in the southern side of the Kursk salient.\\\\u00bb\\\\n[2] \\\\u00abOperation Mars | Operation Mars, also known as the Second Rzhev-Sychevka Offensive Operation (Russian: \\\\u0412\\\\u0442\\\\u043e\\\\u0440\\\\u0430\\\\u044f \\\\u0420\\\\u0436\\\\u0435\\\\u0432\\\\u0441\\\\u043a\\\\u043e-\\\\u0421\\\\u044b\\\\u0447\\\\u0451\\\\u0432\\\\u0441\\\\u043a\\\\u0430\\\\u044f \\\\u043d\\\\u0430\\\\u0441\\\\u0442\\\\u0443\\\\u043f\\\\u0430\\\\u0442\\\\u0435\\\\u043b\\\\u044c\\\\u043d\\\\u0430\\\\u044f \\\\u043e\\\\u043f\\\\u0435\\\\u0440\\\\u0430\\\\u0446\\\\u0438\\\\u044f), was the codename for an offensive launched by Soviet forces against German forces during World War II.
