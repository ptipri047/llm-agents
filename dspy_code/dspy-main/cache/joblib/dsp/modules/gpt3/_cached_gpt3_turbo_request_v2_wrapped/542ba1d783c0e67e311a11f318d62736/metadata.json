We know that the 1972 FA Charity Shield was contested between Manchester City and Aston Villa. To find out the year the club founded that played against Manchester City, we need to search for the founding year of Aston Villa.\\\\n\\\\nQuery: \\\\\"Aston Villa founding year\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nContext:\\\\n[1] \\\\u00abEmpire State Building | The Empire State Building is a 102-story skyscraper located on Fifth Avenue between West 33rd and 34th Streets in Midtown, Manhattan, New York City. It has a roof height of 1,250 feet (381 m), and with its antenna included, it stands a total of 1454 ft tall. Its name is derived from the nickname for New York, the Empire State.\\\\u00bb\\\\n[2] \\\\u00abBank of America Plaza (Atlanta) | Bank of America Plaza is a skyscraper located in between Midtown Atlanta and Downtown Atlanta. At 312 m , the tower is the 96th-tallest building in the world. It is the 14th tallest building in the U.S., the tallest building in Georgia and the tallest building in any U.S. state capital, overtaking the 250 m (820 ft), 50 story One Atlantic Center in height, which previously held the record as Georgia\\'s tallest building. It has 55 stories of office space and was completed in 1992, when it was called NationsBank Plaza. Originally intended to be the headquarters for Citizens & Southern National Bank (which merged with Sovran Bank during construction), it became NationsBank\\'s property following its formation in the 1991 hostile takeover of C&S/Sovran by NCNB.\\\\u00bb\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Which is taller, the Empire State Building or the Bank of America Tower?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to answer the question. We know that the Empire State Building has a roof height of 1,250 feet and a total height of 1,454 feet including its antenna. On the other hand, the Bank of America Plaza in Atlanta is 312 meters tall. To compare the heights of the two buildings, we need to convert the height of the Bank of America Plaza from meters to feet.\\\\n\\\\nQuery: \\\\\"Convert 312 meters to feet\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nContext:\\\\n[1] \\\\u00abAleksandr Danilovich Aleksandrov | Aleksandr Danilovich Aleksandrov (Russian: \\\\u0410\\\\u043b\\\\u0435\\\\u043a\\\\u0441\\\\u0430\\\\u0301\\\\u043d\\\\u0434\\\\u0440 \\\\u0414\\\\u0430\\\\u043d\\\\u0438\\\\u0301\\\\u043b\\\\u043e\\\\u0432\\\\u0438\\\\u0447 \\\\u0410\\\\u043b\\\\u0435\\\\u043a\\\\u0441\\\\u0430\\\\u0301\\\\u043d\\\\u0434\\\\u0440\\\\u043e\\\\u0432 , alternative transliterations: \\\\\"Alexandr\\\\\" or \\\\\"Alexander\\\\\" (first name), and \\\\\"Alexandrov\\\\\" (last name)) (August 4, 1912 \\\\u2013 July 27, 1999), was a Soviet/Russian mathematician, physicist, philosopher and mountaineer.\\\\u00bb\\\\n[2] \\\\u00abAleksandr Pavlovich Aleksandrov | Aleksandr Pavlovich Aleksandrov (Russian: \\\\u0410\\\\u043b\\\\u0435\\\\u043a\\\\u0441\\\\u0430\\\\u043d\\\\u0434\\\\u0440 \\\\u041f\\\\u0430\\\\u0432\\\\u043b\\\\u043e\\\\u0432\\\\u0438\\\\u0447 \\\\u0410\\\\u043b\\\\u0435\\\\u043a\\\\u0441\\\\u0430\\\\u043d\\\\u0434\\\\u0440\\\\u043e\\\\u0432 ; born February 20, 1943) is a former Soviet cosmonaut and twice Hero of the Soviet Union (November 23, 1983 and December 29, 1987).\\\\u00bb\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Who is older, Aleksandr Danilovich Aleksandrov or Anatoly Fomenko?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the query.

Chew. Joe was an Eastside drug lord who preferred a peaceful solution to business disputes when possible. He was responsible for creating the lucrative New Day Co-Op with Stringer Bell, supplying much of Baltimore with heroin brought into the city by \\\\\"The Greeks\\\\\". Joe was a portly and amiable presence, but was often a match in wits for rival drug lords Avon Barksdale and Marlo Stanfield, and was able to manipulate most situations to his advantage. His nickname stemmed from his trademark phrase \\\\\"I\\'ve got a proposition for you\\\\\", going back to his days selling test answers on the school yard. Along with Poot Carr, Wee-Bey Brice, Omar Little, and Bubbles, he is one of the few characters from the drug trade to appear in every season.\\\\u00bb\\\\n[2] \\\\u00abLeo Gorcey | Leo Bernard Gorcey (June 3, 1917\\\\u2013 June 2, 1969) was an American stage and movie actor who became famous for portraying the leader of the group of young hooligans known variously as the Dead End Kids, The East Side Kids, and as an adult, The Bowery Boys. Always the most pugnacious member of the gangs in which he participated, young Leo was the filmic prototype of the young punk. He was the shortest member of the original gang.\\\\u00bb\\\\n[3] \\\\u00abMiddle East Peace Facilitation Act of 1993 | For hundreds of years, the Middle East has been a hotbed of violent disagreement, extremist tactics and nearly continual upheaval. Discord between Jews and Muslims in the region containing their holiest of sites seems like a problem without a solution. In spite of this there have been a long series of attempted solutions to the problem of the Holy Land, from European powers, from the United Nations and eventually the United States. One of the earliest American solutions was the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act of 1993. An attempt to use the economic and finical might to promote the post-Oslo peace, the Act is a fascinating example of the American domestic policy process and how it can effect the nature of world events. Ultimately, the Peace Act would not save the fragile peace planted in the early 1990s, but it would create a precedent of American aid to both sides of the Israli-Plaestian conflict which continues today.\\\\u00bb\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: What American actor plays an East side drug lord who prefers peaceful solutions to business disputes when possible?\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1692121280.8303266}
