The Liga Peruana de Football was established in 1912. It was an amateur league that lasted until 1921 due to scheduling and organizing conflicts. In this league only teams from Lima participated. In 1926, the Peruvian Football Federation took control of organizing the tournament and continued the Peruvian Primera Divisi\\\\u00f3n with the introduction of teams from Callao. In 1951, the Primera Divisi\\\\u00f3n turned professional and in 1966, the Torneo Descentralizado was founded in which the first non-capital teams were invited to play the first national championship. Between 1996 and 2008, the Apertura and Clausura format was adopted.\\\\u00bb\\\\n[2] \\\\u00abTeodoro Fern\\\\u00e1ndez | Teodoro Fern\\\\u00e1ndez Meyz\\\\u00e1n (born 20 May 1913 in Ca\\\\u00f1ete \\\\u2014 died 17 September 1996 in Lima), nicknamed \\\\\"Lolo\\\\\", was a Peruvian football striker.
